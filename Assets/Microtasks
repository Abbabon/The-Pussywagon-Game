- touch controller:

	- pump
	- sails
	- cooler?
	- boost

- define 'screen parts' for the touch controls? or just for the cooler

- boost handle mock visuals (find some)

- Sails 3 levels of folding (with timer to gently return them)

- engine level mock -> real thing (via animation)

- implement other systems:

	- engine behavior
	- fuel system
	- speed

- speedometer

- particles to indicate speed ?
